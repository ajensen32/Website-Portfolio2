Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a senior computer science student at the University of South Dakota and looking for a place to start my career!

Throughout my time as a computer science student, I have built a fundamental understanding of software
development, including various programming languages, application design, and problem-solving techniques.I primarily code in **C#** and **JavaScript**, but am always willing to become more proficient in other languages!
